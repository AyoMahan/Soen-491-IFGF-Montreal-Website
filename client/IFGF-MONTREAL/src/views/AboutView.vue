  <h1 class="display-6">Mesage from our Pastor</h1>
  <p>We believe in the following The Bible to be the inspired, the only infallible, authoritative Word of God. And there is ONLY one God, eternally existent in three persons: Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit. We believe in the deity of our Lord Jesus Christ, in His virgin birth, in His sinless life, in His miracles, in His vicarious and atoning death through His shed blood, in His bodily resurrection, in His ascension to the right hand of the Father, and in His personal return in power and glory. We believe that for the salvation of lost and sinful man, regeneration of the Holy Spirit is absolutely essential in the present ministry of the Holy Spirit by whose indwelting the Christian is enabled to live a godly life. We believe in the resurrection of both the saved and the lost; they that are saved unto the resurrection of life and they that are lost unto the resurrection of damnation. And we also believe in the spiritual unity of believers in our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
