  <h1 class="display-6">Care Groups</h1>
  <p>Care groups are gatherings of individuals within our community who come together regularly for fellowship, support, and spiritual growth. These groups typically consist of around 6 to 12 members and are led by a facilitator or group leader, who guides discussions and activities.

The primary purpose of care group is to provide a supportive environment where members can deepen their relationship with God, study the Bible, share their faith journeys, and pray for one another. These groups offer a sense of belonging and community within the larger church body, fostering friendships and accountability among members.

Care groups may meet in various settings, including homes, church buildings, or online platforms. Meetings typically include a time of fellowship, prayer, Bible study, and discussion on relevant topics aimed at nurturing spiritual growth and personal development.
