        <p class="description">
          Care groups are gatherings of individuals within our community who come together 
          regularly for fellowship, support, and spiritual growth. These groups typically 
          consist of around 6 to 12 members and are led by a facilitator or group leader, 
          who guides discussions and activities.
        </p>
        <p class="description">
          The primary purpose of a care group is to provide a supportive environment where 
          members can deepen their relationship with God, study the Bible, share their 
          faith journeys, and pray for one another. These groups offer a sense of belonging 
          and community within the larger church body, fostering friendships and accountability 
          among members.
        </p>
        <p class="description">
          Care groups may meet in various settings, including homes, church buildings, or 
          online platforms. Meetings typically include a time of fellowship, prayer, Bible 
          study, and discussion on relevant topics aimed at nurturing spiritual growth and 
          personal development.
